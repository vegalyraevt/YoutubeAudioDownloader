# YoutubeAudioDownloader
Lets you download one or multiple youtube videos as a MP3 at the max quality of the video with a simple GUI. It will pull the max quality of the audio automatically.
Videos must be entered with this format to download more than one at a time "VidURL1, VidURL2, VidURL3"
Program is a little messy as it creates error logs and a folder called "rips" at the same location as the exe file. I recomend placing the exe in a folder you want to store these in and then make a shortcut elsewhere to make using it easier!
You can also easily change the save location in the program for your audio rips. I'll add ways to change the save location of error logs and other info to the program "later".

Program is free use under the GPL v3 but if you want to support me for it check out my kofi.
You can also find other programs on my kofi I make or comission one of your own.
